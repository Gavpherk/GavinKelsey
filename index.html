            <h2>Exploit Details</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> A root authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the Arris NVG443B router, commonly supplied to customers of Frontier ISP. This issue allows an attacker to gain root-level access to the device's operating system. The vulnerability is present in firmware version 9.3.0h3d36, but is also confirmed by Arris to exist in later versions as well. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can view filesystem contents, access password hashes of administrative and SSH user accounts, and potentially make modifications to the filesystem and further compromise the device.</p>
            <p><strong>Technical Details:</strong></p>
            <p>The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the router's login shell, located at /bin/cshell and the defective function is located at RVA 0x165C0. During testing via UART connection, it was discovered that sending the command "^e" terminates the "sdb" task. When the "sdb" task is terminated, the login shell erroneously grants root access without requiring authentication credentials.</p>
            <h3>Steps to Reproduce:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Connect to the router via UART interface.</li>
                <li>Access the login shell.</li>
                <li>Inject the command "^e" to terminate the "sdb" task.</li>
                <li>Observe that the login shell grants root access without prompting for any credentials.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This sequence of actions effectively bypasses all authentication mechanisms, granting full control over the router's operating system.</p>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gain root access to the router's operating system.</li>
                <li>View sensitive filesystem contents.</li>
                <li>Access password hashes of administrative and SSH user accounts.</li>
                <li>Potentially modify the router's filesystem, leading to further compromise or disruption.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The vendor, Arris, has been notified of this issue and has released a patch to address the vulnerability. Meaning this no longer effects customers because the ISP ships these updates out automatically.</p>
